## Main Goal 🎈
The main goal was to have a way of showing some of the artist work, his drawings. And with a contact page for potential writters looking for an artist.<br>
But we also wanted to make an few steps forward maybe a website with room for some fans. A place where people could read about their favorite comicbook artist,
a place to buy merch and maybe more.<br>
We needed a good and clean design with animations that communicated the artist personality.



## Process 🏈
The main design was made with Adobe Illustrator and Figma.<br>
When the time came, I started coding with HTML and CSS for a basic main page.<br>
Using EJS I made the partials, including the navbar that I would be using for mobile, and for large screens.<br>
Then, I made simple animations with jQuery.

In terms of backend, I wanted a database and an easy way to let the client upload and manage the website, so I needed to build a dashboard, with authentication for security.<br>
The backend uses Node.js with Express.<br>
Before connecting a database, I made the dashboard.<br>
When everything was finished, I connected the MongoDB database, then I implemented the cloudinary API, so images
went to cloudinary.<br>
I used passport.js for authentication in the admin dashboard.
